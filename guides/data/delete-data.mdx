This page shows you how to use the delete endpoint to remove documents from an index.

## Delete documents by IDs

Since AIMP documents can always be efficiently accessed using their ID,
deleting by ID is the most efficient way to remove specific records.

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  --url https://{baseUrl}/{apiVersion}/projects/{projectId}/indexes/{indexName}/docs/delete \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  --data '{
  "ids": [
    "<string>",
    "<string>",
    ...
  ]
}'
```

## Delete documents by query

To delete documents based on their data, pass a `filter` query to the delete operation.
This deletes all document matching the filter query.

For example, to delete all documents with genre “documentary” and year 2019 from an index, use the following code:

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  --url https://{baseUrl}/{apiVersion}/projects/{projectId}/indexes/{indexName}/docs/delete \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  --data '{
  "filter": {
    "queryString": {
      "query": "genre:documentary AND year:2019"
    }
  }
}'
```

## Delete an entire index

To remove all documents from an index,
[delete the index](/guides/indexes/manage-indexes#delete-an-index) and
[recreate it](/guides/indexes/create-an-index)
