title: Bulk upsert data
---

Besides the upsert operation which has 6MB maximum payload size limit,
AIMP also supports bulk upsert operation to insert or update multiple documents up to 200MB at once.

First, get the required information to upload payload to object storage:

```bash
AIMP_PROJECT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

curl -i -X GET \
  "https://{baseUrl}/{apiVersion}/projects/{project_id}/indexes/{index_name}/docs/bulk-upsert" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: $AIMP_PROJECT_API_KEY'
```

The response will look like this:

```json
{
  "url": "<string>",
  "type": "application/json",
  "httpMethod": "PUT",
  "objectKey": "<string>",
  "sizeLimitBytes": 209715200
}
```

Upload your documents as a one object using the provided URL
and call `bulk-upsert` API with the corresponding `objectKey` you've just uploaded:

```bash
AIMP_PROJECT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

curl -i -X POST \
  "https://{baseUrl}/{apiVersion}/projects/{project_id}/indexes/{index_name}/docs/bulk-upsert" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: $AIMP_PROJECT_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "objectKey": "<string>"
  }'
```
