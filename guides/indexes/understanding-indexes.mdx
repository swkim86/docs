title: Understanding indexes
---

An AIMP index is a logical namespace that holds a collection of documents,
where each document is a collection of fields — which, in turn,
are key-value pairs that contain your data.

Indexes are not the same as you’d find in a relational database.
Think of an AIMP project as a database that can contain many indexes you can consider as a table,
and within each index, you have many documents.

* RDBMS => Databases => Tables => Columns/Rows
* AIMP => Projects => Indexes => Documents with key-value pairs

AIMP provides a RESTful JSON-based API for interacting with document data.
You can index, search, and delete documents by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints.
These CRUD-like operations can take place at an individual document level or at the index level itself.

## Index classes

AIMP provides two types of index classes based on access frequency: `STANDARD` and `INFREQUENT_ACCESS`.

* `STANDARD` indexes are optimized for high-throughput, low-latency access to your data.
* `INFREQUENT_ACCESS` indexes are optimized for infrequent access to your data.

## Zero-copy index clone

Zero-copy index clone is a feature that allows you to create a new index by cloning an existing index,
without physically copying index data.

This feature is useful when you want to create a new index with the same schema and data as an existing index,
in order to load-test, develop, and experiment in an isolated environment.
